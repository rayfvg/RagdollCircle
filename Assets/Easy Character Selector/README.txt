Hello friend, thank you for purchasing our asset.

Here is a quick guide to using:
before using please look in the Prefabs folder how the Objects are arranged!
How to add your characters to the shops?
1) add a BoxCollider to your objects with IsTrigger checked
2) add the Character script to your characters
4) you can add as many characters as you need, they are all evenly distributed around the circle
4) fill in all the fields in the inspector, namely: ID, Price, Name, if you want the character to be initially available to the player, check the IsOpened checkbox;
5) ATTENTION start ID from 0!
6)In order for your characters to appear in the store, they need to be added to the stage in the CharacterManager object in the CharacresPrefabs field. First, add a character with ID 0, and so on as you increase!
I hope everything works out for you
